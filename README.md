We are a group of students at the Technical University of Denmark who have been given a final project in this 3-week Introductory Programming class that requires us to create a close to complete game of the Danish household game "Matador." 

## Installation
Download the zip-folder, and run the jar file.
It is required that Java is installed on the computer. 

## Further Contribution
This project is free for other developers to contribute to. 
We recommend reading our documentation before contributing. We've made a Javadoc folder, which can be found in the project folder.
