/*
    In this class we've created a method that takes in a gui_player and player as arguments. When the arguments are
    passed they'll get used in the body of the method, which will first display what will happen to the player
    who pulls the card, and make them pull the card by pressing OK, then lastly the money will be set, and
    showed on the gui.

    We've chosen to make the class extend the class ChanceCardParent, so that we did not have to make an
    instance of the GUI class in every chance card class. This way, our code adheres to the information expert
    as a design pattern.
